# checkbox_tutorial

This tutorial familiarizes new programmers with the strategy behind taking a novel data visualization idea and transforming it into working code within a program. As an example, we discuss the approach that we took to create a datatable that is embedded with checkboxes within an R Shiny application. The tutorial is broken up into five main parts: 

1) How to approach a programming challenge
2) How to properly research & cite existing examples from the internet
3) How to identify changes to the code
4) How to implement changes to the code to achieve your idea
5) Final code for our example
